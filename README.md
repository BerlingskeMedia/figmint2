# üçÉ Figmint

The goal of this project is that you will be able to point it at a figma file and sync all the shared styles from that file with your JS application.

## Install

Add figma sync to your project:

```
yarn add figmint --dev
```

You can then run via the CLI

```
yarn run figmint
```

Its also possible to run in watch mode so when you make changes in figma they are updated right away by figmint:

```
yarn run figmint watch
```

## Config

To connect to your figma file you'll need to add both a token and the file ID.

Figmint uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) for configuration file support. This means you can configure figmint via:

- A `.figmintrc` file, written in YAML or JSON, with optional extensions: .yaml/.yml/.json.
- A `.figmintrc.toml` file, written in TOML (the .toml extension is required).
- A `figmint.config.js` or `.figmintrc.js` file that exports an object.
- A "figmint" key in your package.json file.

The configuration file will be resolved starting from the location of the file being formatted, and searching up the file tree until a config file is (or isn't) found.

### Config Options

###### token

Your [figma token](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#access-tokens)

###### file

The file ID you want to sync. In your figma file click `Share` and the copy the link. It'll look something like:

```
https://www.figma.com/file/P2X8Apme93sfEN8wACKziOxq/FileName
```

in this case the file ID is `P2X8Apme93sfEN8wACKziOxq`

###### output (default: `figmaStyles`)

Figmint writes any styles it finds to a js file. By default this file is written to a `./figmaStyles/` directory. If you would like to use a different location you can add an `output` to your config.

Output supports nested directories, so `some/directory/figma` as output would result in a new file `./some/directory/figma/` being created.

###### typescript (default: `false`)

If set to true this will generate typescript types in your export.
